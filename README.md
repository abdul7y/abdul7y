## ☁️ About Me

I'm Abdullah Ali, a passionate **Cloud & DevOps Engineer** with hands-on experience in containerization, CI/CD automation, and cloud deployments. Currently pursuing my **BS in Software Engineering at MAJU**, I focus on building scalable infrastructure and deploying full-stack apps using modern DevOps tools.

I enjoy working with **Dockerized microservices**, setting up **CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions**, and deploying to cloud platforms like **AWS and Render**. I also use **Bash scripting** to automate day-to-day tasks and streamline system operations.

I'm actively building a portfolio of cloud-hosted projects and exploring tools like **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**. I’m open to **internships** and **cloud-focused roles** that offer hands-on experience and long-term growth in DevOps and Cloud Engineering.

## 🔧 Real-World Projects

### 🚀 Cloud Kitchen App (MERN + Docker + CI/CD)  
A full-stack food delivery platform with frontend, backend, and MongoDB services — fully containerized using Docker. CI/CD workflow built with GitHub Actions and deployed via Render and Netlify.

###  DevOps Pipeline Simulation  
Simulated a complete CI/CD pipeline: code pushed → test → build Docker image → deploy. Managed with Docker Compose and GitHub Actions to reflect real-world delivery flows.

###  Static Web Hosting (AWS S3 + CloudFront)  
Hosted a React frontend on AWS S3 with SSL, versioning, and global CDN via CloudFront. Configured secure bucket policies to mimic production environments.

###  Automated Server Setup (Bash + NGINX + Docker)  
Wrote Bash scripts to install and configure NGINX, Docker, and Node.js on Linux servers. Automated logging setup, permissions, and environment bootstrapping.
